# About

The image files and `Makefile` here use [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)
to assemble a title screen image from various parts (including rendering
text), and then scale the final results and reduce its colors so it can
be displayed by the Atari.  It creates two image files -- a 16-color
full-screen bitmap and a 2-color image to overlay using Player/Missile
Graphics.
