This folder contains the two fonts (character sets, aka tile graphics)
used by this game.  Please see the [Development Docs](../DEVELOPMENT.md)
for additional details.

Originally, the game used just two character sets, with a few shapes
that different to provide two frames of animation (fire, water spray,
gas leaks, the exit sign, and workers).

Earlier font, with 8x8 tile graphics from earlier beta releases of the game.

Later, a larger set of tiles were created that allow for higher resolution
shapes in the game (8x16 pixels, rather than 8x8 pixels, while taking
up the same amount of space on a 20x11 map of tiles).  A simple PHP
script, [`shape_pbm_to_fnt.php`](../tools/shape_pbm_to_fnt.php), was
created that generates four full fonts based on the text font, and a bitmap
graphic.

High resolution (8x16) tile graphics now used in the game.

The numerals, punctuation, and uppercase characters are meant to
evoke the letters seen on the side of a firetruck in the US.

The first half of the font is used on lines of text -- the top large
line of text on the title screen and in-game, and the smaller lines
of text on the title screen and status bar in-game.  Four special
characters are amongst them:

* `@` -- âœ  Maltese Cross (firefighter badge); used in the title
* `]` -- ax; used in game to indicate you've collected the ax
* `^` -- ðŸ”¥ fire; used in game to represent how many workers have perished
* `_` -- â†µ carriage return; used when entering high score initials

The first 59 characters (ATASCII / ASCII space through `Z`) may be entered
as high score initials.

The second half of the font is used as in-game tile graphics,
representing both objects and obstacles, as well as the player,
workers, fire, gas leaks, and water.  (See [shapes.h](../src/shapes.h).)
