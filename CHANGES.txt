0.1-beta-8 (2023-09-24):
 * TBD

0.1-beta-7 (2023-09-21):
 * Gameplay:
   * Pushing joystick into a valve no longer causes it
     to toggle open/close quickly.  Release joystick,
     then push into the valve again to toggle.
 * Splash:
   * Added a splash screen (disk version)
 * Title screen:
   * Pause [Select] key repeat when wrapping back to level 1
 * Help screen:
   * Page breaks every horizontal rule (section break).
 * Building:
   * "tools/release.sh" checks Makefile version vs README.md
   * WIP - Optimizations:
     (h/t https://github.com/ilmenit/CC65-Advanced-Optimizations
     and Irgendwer @ AtariAge)
     * `--static-locals` (instead of using the stack (slower))
     * Replaced a bunch of `int` (habit!) with `char`
     * Replaced `enum` constants with `#define`-ed ones
     * Avoid multiplication when doing shape look-up and placement
       (`shape_at()` and `set_shape()` now use a look-up table)
     * Replaced some "+= 2" and "-= 2" with "++" and "--" twice.
     * Improved Display List construction (some use of `memset()`
       or static arrays)

0.1-beta-6 (2023-09-16):
 * Gameplay:
   * When a worker dies, there's a short grace period
     until the game will allow another worker to die.
   * Ability to slide along obstacles when pushing diagonally.
   * Ax indicator moved from top right to top left; using icon.
   * Exit counter moved from top left to top right.
 * Help screen:
   * Help text word-wrapped at 38 chars (instead of 40);
     improves readability if you [C]opy "D:README.TXT,E:" from DOS
     with Atari OS's default left-margin of 2
 * Two more levels

0.1-beta-5 (2023-09-13):
 * Gameplay:
   * Lose 3 workers and the game ends.
 * High score table:
   * Top-10 high scores labeled (1...10)
 * Help screen:
   * Added numbering & indentation to documentation
 * Bugfixes:
   * Score deductions (e.g., crate destruction) with a very
     low score (e.g., 000000) could cause score to wrap around
     to a crazy high value.

0.1-beta-4 (2023-09-04):
 * Gameplay:
   * Exit countdown (when pushing into door) dropped from 5 to 3
     (h/t Will)
   * Hint to player to push door to initial exit countdown
   * Bonus tally timing made consistent (regardless of score added)
   * High score initials input at end of game
   * High score(s) recorded (top-10, saved to disk, in disk version)
     + Saving to sector 720 for easy extraction on TNFS servers
       for FujiNet high score functionality
     + Enabled high-score storage support in the ATR disk image file
 * Title screen:
   * High score table screen (disk version) (access via [H])
   * Improved [Select] key repeat for level select
 * Help screen:
   * Ability to page backwards
 * Character set (font) improvements:
   * Added missing connectors on some corner pipes
   * Stylized more punctuation.
   * "EOL" symbol for high score initial entry
 * Under the hood:
   * Level data is compressed

0.1-beta-3 (2023-08-25):
 * Disable attract mode.
 * Score deduction when crates are destroyed by fire, too (not just ax).
 * Added an explicit "BLANK" shape const, to avoid hard-coded zeros (0).
 * Reorganized/updated instructions on title screen.
   (h/t rdefabri & Beeblebrox @ AtariAge forums)
 * Character set (font) improvements:
   + Stylized "&" and "!"
   + Better large fire; avoid touching sides
   + Nudged valves & brick walls
   + Smaller door & crates (avoid touching sides)
 * "tools/release.sh" checks Makefile version vs 'git tag',
   echos a bunch of info about the release process

0.1-beta-2 (2023-08-23):
 * Gas leaks don't appear instantly, giving you a chance to walk through
   them if using one joystick (where you cannot walk while spraying).
   (h/t phigan & JLsoft on AtariAge forums for reporting)
 * Stick setting & latest level saved as config file on disk (ATR) version
 * Finished doc'ing functions & routines with source code comments

0.1-beta-1 (2023-08-22):
