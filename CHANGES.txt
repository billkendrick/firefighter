     FujiNet device's App Key storage
   * Added 2019-era design doc scribbles.

0.1-beta-7 (2023-09-21):
 * Gameplay:
   * Pushing joystick into a valve no longer causes it

 * Title screen:
   * Pause [Select] key repeat when wrapping back to level 1
 * Help screen:
   * Page breaks every horizontal rule (section break).
 * Building:
   * "tools/release.sh" checks Makefile version vs README.md
   * WIP - Optimizations:
     (h/t https://github.com/ilmenit/CC65-Advanced-Optimizations
     and Irgendwer @ AtariAge)
     * `--static-locals` (instead of using the stack (slower))
     * Replaced a bunch of `int` (habit!) with `char`
     * Replaced `enum` constants with `#define`-ed ones
     * Avoid multiplication when doing shape look-up and placement
       (`shape_at()` and `set_shape()` now use a look-up table)
     * Replaced some "+= 2" and "-= 2" with "++" and "--" twice.
     * Improved Display List construction (some use of `memset()`
       or static arrays)

0.1-beta-6 (2023-09-16):
 * Gameplay:
   * When a worker dies, there's a short grace period
     until the game will allow another worker to die.
   * Ability to slide along obstacles when pushing diagonally.
   * Ax indicator moved from top right to top left; using icon.
   * Exit counter moved from top left to top right.
 * Help screen:
   * Help text word-wrapped at 38 chars (instead of 40);

     with Atari OS's default left-margin of 2

 * Help screen:
   * Added numbering & indentation to documentation
 * Bugfixes:
   * Score deductions (e.g., crate destruction) with a very
     low score (e.g., 000000) could cause score to wrap around
     to a crazy high value.
