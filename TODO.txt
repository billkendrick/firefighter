 * Game-ending event.  Possible ideas:
   + Losing all workers on the current level
   + Losing 3 workers throughout the game (a la "Stampede");
     would do you 'earn' any back?
 * More levels
   (reminder: tweak LEVELS variable declaration in Makefile!)
 * Ability to page backwards on help screen
   (cc65 ftell()/fseek()/fgetpos()/fsetpos() not implemented;
   will need to use XIO calls to NOTE & POINT)
