 * Explain exit sequence (push, countdown) on the title screen too
   (h/t rdefabri & Beeblebrox @ AtariAge forums)
 * More levels
 * High score tracking
 * High score table on disk version
   (best way to ensure it's easy for FujiNet high score sharing!?)
 * Ability to page backwards on help screen
   (had difficulty using ftell()/fseek() or fgetpos()/fsetpos())
